# Movie-Review-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning
My final project from my DATA-301. Data Exploration for from 3 separate Kaggle datasets.

This is an DEA(data exploration analysis) project of movies combined with the creation of a machine learning model that attempts to predict individual movie critic review scores(0-100) based on available data 
such as the critic review text, movie description, movie film rating, the movie budget and the movie box office.

Juptyer Notebooks are meant to be ran in this order: Data_Exploration.ipynb , Data_Collection.ipynb, Machine_Learning_Code.ipynb

The Data_Collection.ipynb files were ran on the Kaggle environment originally and will need the specified files listed inside to run. 
Running the entire notebook successfully will give you the movie_reviews_with_info.csv file that is run on the other notebooks.



Please note that there are no CSV files here due to the file sizes being anywhere from 30mB to 700mB, which are far beyond Github's ability to store.
